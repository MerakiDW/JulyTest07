A JavaScript for loop is a type of loop that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of iterations. The basic syntax is as follows:

for (initializer; condition; iterator) {
  // loop body: statement(s)
}

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each part:

Initializer: Sets the initial value of a variable (usually a counter) used in the loop.
Condition: Specifies the condition that determines whether the loop should continue or terminate. The condition is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration.
Iterator: Updates the variable (usually the counter) used in the loop after each iteration.
Example 1: Simple Counting Loop

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
